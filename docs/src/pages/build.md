# Build

QFeeds uses a *Makefile* to position sources for Chrome and Firefox browsers


# Directory structure

2 types of folders -- unmodified (committed to version control) and
build output (generated by *Makefile*)


##  Unmodified

* `chrome/` -- Files for integration into the chrome of the browser
  (icon, `background.js`, etc.)

* `qfeeds/` -- Main source code

* `docs/` -- Hacking QFeeds


## Output folders

* `lib/` -- Source code of libraries is downloaded here

* `chrome-qfeeds/` -- Sources packages to run on Google Chrome

* `firefox-qfeeds/` -- Sources packaged to run on Mozilla Firefox


# Build via make

* First, run `make libs`, this populates folder `lib/` by downloading
  and unpackaging the source code of all external libraries needed by
  QFeeds

* Run `make all`, this populates folders `chrome-qfeeds/` and
  `firefox-qfeeds/`.
  
  Run `make all` **every time** after modifications of the source code
  to place the source files in the appropriate places for the 2
  browsers.
